# Copying the files

You've successfully downloaded the older version, now it's time to actually make the changes.

When the download finished, you would have seen a message show up reading something like the following.

```
Depot download complete : "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_620980\depot_620981" (327 files, manifest 1175216641760077721)
```

To finish the process, just copy everything from the path in the message on top of your Beat Saber install, overwriting all conflicting files.

Even though there's a decent chance of things working, I'd strongly recommend deleting your **Plugins** folder and reinstalling all your mods with ModAssistant.
