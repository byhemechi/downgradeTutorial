# Setup

Until around 2019 it was possible to downgrade games straight from Steam.

Unfortunately, due to pressure from developers and (mainly) publishers, the client's been updated to block usage of the `download_depot` command.

Fortunately, a tool has been to restore this functionality.

## Steps

1. Open steam to the **Library** page
2. Download **SteamDepotDownpatcher.exe** from [SteamManifestPatcher's GitHub](https://github.com/fifty-six/zig.SteamManifestPatcher/releases/tag/v3.2)
3. Run the patcher

If everything worked out, you should get a message along the lines of

```
Got process handle.
Module handle address: 6b4c0000
68 60 C9 25 6C
Addr: 6b8de32d
Wrote patch to memory.
Press ENTER to close.
```
